# LightKeysTransfer

Free, OpenSource utility for securely performing some configuration related activities.

Status: Early Stages, Active Development.

## Problem:
TOES - Terrorist Odour Mafia i.e the psychos/hackers/identity thieves/identity distorters/human rights violators/mafia/extortionists/privacy violators/Intellectual property thieves with powerful 
swarm of spying invisible micro-drones capable of viewing, screenshotting, listening, whispering, emitting / re-playing audio and even mind-reading. They even do imitate, stalk, pry, shadow, harass, stalking, postal manipulation etc...

Pssst: They are anonymous/mafia/hackers, but they try to put the blame on western world! In my opinion, there is a probability that the TOES might be an extreme unit of India's R&AW 
(Research And Analysis Wing - India's spying organization)

The virtual GFs and virtual spouses stories of the mafia sl*ts are created by the mafia with the equipment.

Eitherway because of their equipment, they can easily hack and steal i.e they can unleash chaos - chaotic disodour.

This tool helps in few cases.

I have my own startups [ALight Technology And Services Limited](https://www.alightservices.com/)
 based in United Kingdom and [ALight Technologies USA Inc](https://www.alightservices.com/) based in United States.

I don't have any other employees yet! I do everything from end-to-end leveraging cloud infrastructure in Azure and AWS.

These tools are based on usual good practices for handling production secrets.

I am hoping these tools would help someone.

The entire code base is based on .Net, developed in C#.
